# BakingApp
This project is being created for the Android Nanodegree program. The rubric
for this project can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/829/view).

## Features
In this project, I am learning about Fragments, ExoPlayer, the Master/Detail
flow design pattern, Widgets, and Espresso.

## Libraries
* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
* [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)

## Plan
1. First, I will look at the JSON data and implement a Retrofit query to retrieve that data and create some relevant classes.
2. Next, I plan to create the MainActivity CardView for the recipes. 
3. Then, I plan to create the two-pane layout for tablets showing the 
ingredients and steps in one pane and the ExoPlayer and the detailed 
instructions in the other using the [master/detail flow](https://inducesmile.com/android/android-fragment-masterdetail-flow-tutorial-in-android-studio/) design pattern.
4. After that, it should not be difficult to create a single-fragment Activity
called RecipeDetailActivity that loads the Detail Fragment for the phone 
layout. 
5. Once the basic app is complete, I plan to create a Widget.
6. Finally, I plan to do some Espresso testing.
