# BakingApp
This project is being created for the Android Nanodegree program. The rubric
for this project can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/829/view).

## Features
In this project, I am learning about Fragments and Exoplayer.

## Libraries
* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)

## Plan
1. First, I will look at the JSON data and implement a Retrofit query to retrieve that data and create some relevant classes.
